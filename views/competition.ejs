            <p>
              This event is gender neutral, noting that a competitor qualifies
              for their dance level based on either Leader or Follower points,
              whichever is highest. This defines their primary role as a leader
              or follower throughout the event.
            </p>
            <p>
              Competitors are allowed to also compete in their non-dominant role
              up to two levels down in competitions, unless they are required to
              move up based on the WSDC points for their secondary role.
              Competitors with points qualifying both their primary and
              secondary roles to the same skill level are required to choose
              only one to compete with. E.g. Competitors cannot compete in
              Intermediate Jack and Jill as both a leader and follower.
            </p>
            <p>
              Petitions to compete at a lower competition level must be made to
              the Event Director in writing no later than 3 days before the
              event. Petitions to compete at higher levels are managed by the
              World Swing Dance Council (WSDC) and approved requests must be
              provided to the event no later than registration check in at the
              event.

            <h3 class="p-0 mt-4">Jack & Jill Competition</h3>
            <p>
              Jack & Jill competitions are designed to highlight skills in
              spontaneous WCS dancing and the ability to dance well with a
              variety of partners.
            </p>
            <p>
              Competitors enter as individuals, are randomly assigned partners,
              and dance to music pre-selected by the DJ. Dancers will be judged
              individually in the heats & as a couple in the final.
            </p>

            <h3 class="p-0 mt-4">Lucky Switched Competition</h3>
            <p>
              Lucky Switched is designed as a fun competition where the lead and
              follow role is switched back and forth between partners, multiple
              times throughout a song.
            </p>
            <p>
              Competitors enter as individuals, are randomly assigned partners,
              and dance to music pre-selected by the DJ. Competitors will
              compete with the same partner for heats and finals. The structure
              of the competition will be announced at the event. Entries for
              this event are capped and may close before previously announced
              competition.
            </p>
            <p>
              All competitors will compete in the same competition regardless of
              WSDC eligible level.

              of this rule is at the discretion of the Chief Judge, who will
