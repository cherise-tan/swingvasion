              This event is gender neutral, noting that a competitor qualifies
              for their dance level based on either Leader or Follower points,
              whichever is highest. This defines their primary role as a leader
              or follower throughout the event.
            </p>
            <p>
              Competitors are allowed to also compete in their non-dominant role
              up to two levels down in competitions, unless they are required to
              move up based on the WSDC points for their secondary role.
              Competitors with points qualifying both their primary and
              secondary roles to the same skill level are required to choose
              only one to compete with. Eg Competitors cannot compete in
              Intermediate Jack and Jill as both a leader and follower. To
              maintain the intent of newcomers (if it is being offered),
              competitors at intermediate skill level for their primary role can
              not compete in newcomer division in their secondary role.
            </p>
            <p>
              Competitors may compete in different skill levels for different
              competitions if the competitor is eligible for both skill levels.
              Eg. If a competitor is eligible to compete in Novice or
              Intermediate for their primary role, they may dance Intermediate
              Jack and Jill and Novice Strictly. Competitors can not compete in
              the same competition, at different skill levels, in the same role.
              Eg can not compete as a lead in both Novice Strictly and Open
              Strictly Swing.
