            <p>
              Please see the level descriptions below to help you determine
              which workshop level is most appropriate for you.
            </p>

            <h4>Newcomer</h4>
            <p>
              Targeted at people who have been dancing less than a year but open
              to all.
            </p>

            <h4>Open</h4>
            <p>Open to all levels of dancers.</p>

            <h4>Open - Extension</h4>
            <p>Open to all levels but expected to be challenging.</p>

            <h4>Level 2 - Intermediate</h4>
            <p>
              For dancers eligible to dance in the WSDC Intermediate category
              and above.
            </p>

            <h4>Level 3 - Advanced</h4>
            <p>
              For dancers eligible to dance in the WSDC Advanced category and
              above.
            </p>

            <h3 class="p-0 mt-4">Auditions</h3>
            <p>
              We know not everyone likes to compete, or doesn’t get the chance
              to very often, so we will be holding auditions to allow everyone
              the chance to join our level-restricted workshops.
            </p>
            <p>
              Auditions will be held at 10:30 on Saturday morning - dancers will
              have the chance to audition to join the Advanced or Intermediate
              workshop streams.
            </p>
            <p>
              Auditions will run a bit like a Jack and Jill. You’ll have a few
              songs to dance and rotate around your group, while our pro staff
              will be selecting those who can attend the higher-levelled
              workshop.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you’re not sure whether to audition, have a think about what
              impact getting a “no” will have on the rest of your event
              experience - if you think it’s likely to have a negative effect,
              we’d recommend skipping the audition and enjoying the rest of the
              event!

              This is a draft schedule to give you an idea of the weekend and
              help you plan your time with us. It also doesn’t include breaks
              and social dancing (just keeping things simple for now). Things
              can still change during our planning but the start and end time
              for the weekend are locked in!
