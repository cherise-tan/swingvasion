# Swingvasion Website

This is a website I built for Swing Central (a dance business teaching West Coast Swing) in order to increase our online presence, and make it easier for students to find and pay for our classes.<br><br>
It can be viewed at: <a href="swingcentral.nz" target="_blank">swingcentral.nz</a>

## Local Development

- Run the app using `node app.js`
